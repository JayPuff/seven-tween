Considered Features: 

Mutate target option? (Sam feedback)
Tween an objects' nested property? (Complex: Requires being able to send object values and loop through props of those, or 'obj.x.speed' type strings (which disables '.' as a character? (might be fine...)))
Delay,  <---
Repeat, 
Overwrite Mode, 
Tween between colors and units and %s, <---
Take HTMLElements as targets,
Take Array targets,
Don't run step unless we have tweens queued / ongoing
