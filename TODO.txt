Considered Features: 

Mutate target option? (Sam feedback)
Tween an objects' nested property? (Complex: Requires being able to send object values and loop through props of those, or 'obj.x.speed' type strings (which disables '.' as a character? (might be fine...)))
Delay,  <--- DONE
Repeat, <--- DONE
yoyo repeat?,
Overwrite Mode, (complexity???) 
Tween between colors and units and %s, <---
Take HTMLElements as targets,
Take Array targets (make many tweens and return a function that kills all of them??? is that it??? no... onComplete gets complicated etc.)
Don't run step unless we have tweens queued / ongoing <--- DONE



Things on my mind right now:
DOM Mapping => color -> style.color, rotation -> style.transform = rotate(rotation.deg)
Nested Props => Seems hard and introduces a lot of error checking...
Formatter for string value   <----- DONE
Tween from types of value <----- related to DOM px -> em, px -> %, % -> px, % -> number?, number -> px?
Set needs to be made sure that it renders the same way _render does internally (problem is right now, no tween is created which is good I think.)
Need to handle target, or props that stop existing, didn't think this one too deep but keep an eye out to cancel active params or tweens entirely.
if I say on a DOM element -> top: 30, it should know to format to px by default...
